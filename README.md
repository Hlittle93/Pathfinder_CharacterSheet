# Pathfinder_CharacterSheet

Just a CRUD API to display Pathfinder Character Information. It is set up to allow adding, updating, and deleting of several entities. I utilized these entities (users, characters, spells, skills, and game items) in joined tables to manage the relationships between the different models. I also coded in a logger that can help to log any issues with the API. I used some async code to help my program run more smoothly. I also used dictionaries to help parse data from an external database.
